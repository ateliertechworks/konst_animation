 *  Every visual state of the two-film hero is a function of one number: how far
 *  the reader has scrolled through the pinned track, 0 → 1. Nothing here reads
 *  the clock, holds state, or remembers which way the reader was going, which
 *  is precisely what makes the sequence reversible — scrolling up runs it
 *  backward because `frameAt(0.3)` is the same picture whether it was reached
 *  from 0.2 or from 0.4.
 *
 *  Keeping it separate from the component also means the whole storyboard can
 *  be asserted without a browser.
