   * Viewport units alone do not settle it: `svh` is the height with the
   * address bar showing, so the band appears the moment that bar retracts, and
   * even `dvh` is resolved by the CSS engine and can disagree with the height
   * the page actually scrolls through. So the viewport is measured here and
   * published as `--app-vh`, which is what `.panel-h` reads.

   * The measurement is re-taken on resize and on the visual viewport's own
   * changes, rAF-batched, and only written when it actually moved — and
   * `ignoreMobileResize` stops the address bar's resize from making
   * ScrollTrigger recalculate every pin mid-scroll.
